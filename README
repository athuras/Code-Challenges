This directory will contain all the solutions to code challenges that I have undertaken
and are legally or morally able to release on the internet.

While intended mostly as a tool for self-improvement, and historical reference––I'd like to make this
available to whoever is interested. If anyone takes time out of their day to look this over I'd very
much appreciate any feedback at 'athuras [@] gmail [.] com'.

This is as always, a work in progress.
